# LScript

LScript is designed to be an extension to existing applications or APIs to allow for scripting in those projects. Currently, the project is in a state in which it would be unpractical to script in due to the verbose and nontrivial syntax. However, the project is actively being developed and new features are being added.

## Features

- Object oriented
- Garbage collected
- Several library classes included
- Runtime linking of LScript functions to native functions
